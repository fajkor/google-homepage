This project is a Google Homepage clone. No javascript code is used on this ptoject. Only HTML and CSS is used. The form sends the data nowhere. The links link nowhere.

HTML: 
In order to build this project I needed to know some basic HTML. Specifically I used the nav, footer, ul, a, div, form, input, button and img elements. I also gave classes and ids to the elements.

CSS: 
For this project I also used CSS.
I used selectors to target elements, classes and ids. I also used descendant selectors and pseudo-classes.
In order to place the HTML elements on the page I used properties like position (mostly), margin and padding, and their values.

Chrome DevTools: 
I used "inspect" from chrome developer tools mainly to explore CSS selectors, properties and their values on the original Google Homepage and implement those on the Google Homepage clone. I did a very light use of "inspect" on my Google Homepage clone.

Shortcommings: 
I didn't make the page responsive. I haven't used any comments in my code.
